    <h1>Books</h1>
  <h2>By: Savannah Collins</h2>

  Some may ask me why I love to read books instead of playing video games or watchin T.V. I only answer because their is some  much to explore. Once you find the right book for you you will love books as much as I do. When I find the perfect book I just start reading and reading and reading! Whenever I stop to take a break I realiz that I just want to keep reading! So one of these day I reccomend you should pick up a book and start to read it.
